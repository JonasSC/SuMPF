Window functions
================

This section documents classes for window functions.
Some classes require :mod:`scipy` to be available.
If :mod:`scipy` is not available, these classes will be missing in the :mod:`sumpf` module.

The inherited methods of the :class:`~sumpf.Signal` class are not documented here.
