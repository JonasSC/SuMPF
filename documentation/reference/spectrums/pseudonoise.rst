Pseudo-noise spectrums
======================

This section documents classes for spectrums of pseudo-noise.
These spectrums can be transformed to the time domain to have a noise signal with a defined magnitude spectrum.

The inherited methods of the :class:`~sumpf.Spectrum` class are not documented here.
