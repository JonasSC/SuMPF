					There are currently three types of documentation for SuMPF.
					This is due to the fact, that it has been tried to generate
					most of the documentation automatically from the docstrings.
					And none of the tools has been perfect for everything.

				<td class="subsection">Doxygen</td>
				<td class="text">
					The documentation for the classes has been created with
					Doxygen.<br />
					The class index can be found <a href="doxygen/html/classes.html">here</a>.<br />
					If the documentation is not there yet, it might need to be
					built with Doxygen. This can be done with the provided
					<a href="installation.htm#Makefile">Makefile</a>.

				<td class="subsection">ModuleDoc</td>
				<td class="text">
					While doxygen is great for documenting classes, I have not
					got it working for the functions and python submodules of
					SuMPF. So their docstrings have been extracted by the self
					written script ModuleDoc.<br />
					ModuleDoc only documents accessable components of a module.
					For example, it does not show abstract base classes that
					cannot be accessed by importing the module.<br />
					The documentation can be found <a href="moduledoc/sumpf.htm">here</a>.
					If the documentation is not there yet, it might need to be
					built with ModuleDoc. This can be done with the provided

					There are almost no code examples in the documentation, but
					there are some interesting places in the source code to look
					for examples.
					<ul>
						<li>
							There is an "_examples" folder in the sources for SuMPF,
							which some examples programs are given. These examples
							are meant to give code examples, show some features
							of SuMPF and to provide some potentially useful
							functionalities.
						</li>
						<li>
							Shorter and more simple examples can be found in the
							unit tests.
						</li>
						<li>
							There is one example for the connectors in the
							<a href="connectors.htm#Example">documentation for
							the connector decorators</a>. This example might be
							easier than the unit tests.

				<td class="subsection">What's Monkeyforest?</td>
				<td class="text">
					Monkeyforest is a cool measurement system from
					<a href="http://www.four-audio.com">Four Audio</a>. I had
					the honour to use it in a lab at the university and was so
					impressed by the possibilities of acoustical measurements,
					that I wanted to have such a system as well.<br />
					Monkeyforest has two significant drawbacks though:
					<ul>
						<li>It is not free software, which, in my opinion, disqualifies it for productive work.</li>
						<li>And it is DOS based. This somewhat limits the possibilities of user interaction. And the support for modern audio hardware might be poor.</li>
					</ul>
					That's why I started SuMPF.<br />
					Never the less, besides the immense capabilities of Monkeyforest,
					the DOS look-and-feel only adds to the great style of this
					software.
