### License
SuMPF is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL version 3 or later. A copy of
this license is in the LICENSE.txt file. If you did not receive a complete copy
of SuMPF, you can read the license at [the website of the free software foundation](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

### Where to get documentation
The online documentation for SuMPF can be found [here](http://jonassc.github.com/SuMPF/documentation/).
This is the documentation for the "current" branch.

If you have downloaded SuMPF, a copy of the documentation can be found in the
documentation folder. Some of that documentation is automatically generated from
the source code and is therefore not part of the standard repository.
To generate this documentation, you need Doxygen and DoxyPy. The documentation
can be generated with the makefile target "doc" by typing
    `make doc`
in a command line in the SuMPF root folder (where the Makefile is).

*Have fun!*
